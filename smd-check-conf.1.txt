NAME
  smd-check-conf - checks smd configuration file

SYNOPSIS
  smd-check-conf [endpoint]

DESCRIPTION
  smd-check-conf performs some sanity check on a configuration file.
  It mainly tests the translators for a configured endpoint.
  The test consists in listing local and remote mailboxes, calling
  the translators, displaying the result to the user and checking for
  round trip (i.e. that the translators programs behave as inverse
  functions on the current input).

  Refer to smd-config(5) for a longer discussion on translators.

OPTIONS
  endpoint      Is the suffix for the name of the configuration file to use

FILES
  ~/.smd/config.*
