version-1.2.5

- & in EXCLUDE_* breaks shell scripts. smd-common builds a string to be called
  and the & breaks it. Extra quotes and eval could fix the problem, but the
  clean solution is to just rewrite the schellscripts in a decent language.

  workaround: use %26 instead of & in the conf file.

- COPY old TO new + DELETE old can be inefficient on some FS.  If old is
  not neded by other commands, one should implement this with os.rename
