.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsmd-server\fP needs to know a name (\fIendpoint\fP) for the client (that must not
be used by others) and a list of \fImailboxes\fP (directories).
.PP
\fBsmd-server\fP first calls \fBmddiff\fP(1), then prints on stdout the generated
diff. It then accepts from stdin a small set of commands a client
may issue to request a file (or parts of it, like the header).
.PP
\fBsmd-server\fP is in charge of committing the db file used by \fBmddiff\fP(1)
in case the client communicates a successful sync.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP
Increase program verbosity (printed on stderr)
.SH NOTES
\fBsmd-server\fP is a low level utility. You should use higher level tools like
\fBsmd-pull\fP(1) and \fBsmd-push\fP(1)
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBmddiff\fP(1), \fBsmd-client\fP(1), \fBsmd-pull\fP(1), \fBsmd-push\fP(1)
