MAILDIR DIFF
============

maildir diff (mddiff) computes the delta from an old status of a maildir
(previously recorded in a support file) and the current status, generating
a set of commands (a diff) that a third party software can apply to
synchronize a (remote) copy of the maildir.

How it works
------------

This software uses sha1 to compute snapshots of a maildir, and 
computes a set of actions a client should perform to sync with
the mailbox status. This software alone is unable to syncronize
two maildirs. It has to be supported but an higher level tool implementing
the application of actions and data transfer over the network if 
the twin maildir is remote.

To cache the expensive sha1 calculation, a cache file is used.
Every run the program generates a new status file (appending .new)
that must substitute the old one if generated action are committed
to the other maildir. Cache files are specific to the twin maildir,
if you have more than one, you must use a different cache file for
each of them.
