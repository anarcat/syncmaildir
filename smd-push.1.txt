NAME
  smd-push - syncs the remote mail dir letting the local one untouched

SYNOPSIS
  smd-push

DESCRIPTION
  smd-push performs in the remote maildir all the changes that
  were performed on the local one.

  No changes are made on the local maildir. Use smd-pull(1) for that.

  The first time this program is run a new config file is created and
  the user is asked to edit it. That file is composed by the following
  fields

  CLIENTNAME  name of the client host
  SERVERNAME  name of the server host
  MAILBOX A list of directories, separated by space

  The field SERVERNAME must be a valid name for ssh, thus can be an alias like
  smd-server-foo.  The default config file contains an example of how to set up
  an alias for ssh.

  The config file is a regular shell script, refer to bash(1) for 
  its syntax.

FILES
  ~/.smd/config
