NAME
  smd-loop - iterates smd-pull and smd-push

SYNOPSIS
  smd-loop [-vt]

DESCRIPTION
  smd-loop runs smd-push and smd-pull at regular intervals as defined
  by the user in the ~/.smd/loop configuration file. On errors that
  are reported to be transient, its retries a second time before failing.

  The configuration file is like oriented. Each line is composed of
  three space separated fields: pull-frequency, push-frequency and
  endpoint-name. Frequencies are expressed in minutes, while endpoint
  name is a valid name for smd-pull(1) and smd-push(1). Lines
  beginning with # are considered as comments. The following example
  calls the command smd-pull default every 3 minutes, and smd-push default
  every 10. Example:

    # pull-frequency push-frequency endpoint-name
      3              10             default

OPTIONS
  -v  Increase program verbosity (printed on stderr)
  -t  Just create a template configuration file if none

FILES
  ~/.smd/loop
