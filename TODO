- if an avoidable error, but not a network one, happend, show something
- sometimes the quit menu item makes the whole toy freeze. I suspect is it
  not a freeze, but it is waiting for smd-loop to terminate
- add a menu item with the shape of a checkbox to make it possible to pause
  smd-applet
- fix logging, probably the best solution is to make smd-loop
  print something in a log file in ~/.smd/log/loop
