Features:
- add support for "internal-error" to smd-applet, possibly use a
  bugreport action that generates a decent text to attach to the email

Bugs:
- test 28: it may happen that a mail message has \n in his name, and thus the
  mddif output is broken. Fail, but gracefully, reporting an errion in the
  protocol (assert args of commands are not nil)
