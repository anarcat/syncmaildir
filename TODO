- bug in smd-applet not restoring regular icon when network is back
- document hooks
- sample hook for mail on failure
- define and document env variables available to hook
  - can they easily source smd-common?
- it may happen that a mail message has \n in his name, and thus the 
  mddif output is broken. Fail, but gracefully...
