NAME
  smd-server - sends diffs and mails to smd-client

SYNOPSIS
  smd-server [--exclude glob] [-v|--verbose] [-d|--dry-run] endpoint mailboxes

DESCRIPTION
  smd-server needs to know a name (endpoint) for the client (that must not
  be used by others) and a list of mailboxes (directories).

  smd-server first calls mddiff(1), then prints on stdout the generated
  diff. It then accepts from stdin a small set of commands a client
  may issue to request a file (or parts of it, like the header).

  smd-server is in charge of committing the db file used by mddiff(1)
  in case the client communicates a successful sync.

OPTIONS
  -v --verbose    Increase program verbosity (printed on stderr)
  -d --dry-run    Do not perform any action for real
  --exclude glob  Exclude paths matching glob

NOTES
  smd-server is a low level utility. You should use higher level tools like
  smd-pull(1) and smd-push(1)

SEE ALSO
  mddiff(1), smd-client(1), smd-pull(1), smd-push(1)
