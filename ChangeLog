	* support for multiple servers/clients:
	  - config file is now ~/.smd/config.$FOO and smd-push/pull
	    can get an extra argument for FOO, defulat value of FOO is 
	    `default`.

21/4/2009 - minor fix and minor feature release
	* track only mailmessages (skip other stuff like dovecott indexes):
	  - scans only files in cur/ and new/
	* add COPYBODY command to mddiff:
	  - mails that are moved around and then flagged by MUA
	    are not deteceted anymore as new messages, only the new header
	    is transmitted
	  - smd-client honors the command
	* smd-client better reports network errors:
	  - if no data at all is readable from stdin, it means that
	    the transport (ssh) is not working and this is reported to
	    the user as such

19/4/2009 - major bugfix release
	* major bugfix: 
	  - the db file must be in sync too to grant all changes are detected
	  - the mtime has not to be the same on client and server (thus
	    has to be removed from the db file)
	  - adopt xdelta to calculate a patch for the db file (should be
	    better than diff and can scale to binary, compressed, db file)
	* new client/server protocol: 
	  - allows the server to ABORT
	  - handshake checking protocol version and dbfile hash
	  - at the end transmit and apply the xdelta patch
	* db file format changed:
	  - no more mtime column
	  - added db.txt.mtime auxiliary file to stores a global timestamp 
	    for the whole db
	* minor bugfixes in the code (mostly better error reporting)
	* more documentation

12/4/2009 - first public release
	* end-user tools: smd-pull, smd-push
	* stupid endpoint: smd-server
	* endpoint implementing politics: smd-client
	* low-level tool: mddiff
