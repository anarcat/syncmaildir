../4/2009 - major bugfix release
	* major bugfix: 
	  - the db file must be in sync too to grant all changes are detected
	  - the mtime has not to be the same on client and server (thus
	    has to be removed from the db file)
	  - adopt xdelta to calculate a patch for the db file (should be
	    better than diff and can scale to binary, compressed, db file)
	* new client/server protocol: 
	  - allows the server to ABORT
	  - handshake checking protocol version and dbfile hash
	  - at the end transmit and apply the xdelta patch
	* db file format changed:
	  - no more mtime column
	  - added db.txt.mtime auxiliary file to stores a global timestamp 
	    for the whole db
	* minor bugfixes in the code (mostly better error reporting)
	* more documentation
