26/7/2009 - minor bugfix release
	* smd-applet:
	  - when quit was clicked, it was killing every process in
	    its process group, not in the one of its child smd-loop,
	    thus it was killing all other applets started by gnome-applet
	  - configuration window is not pupped up if no config files are
	    found, an error icon and a notification are used instead, and
	    the software wants the configuration files to be available before
	    it actually does something.

26/7/2009 - major feature release
	* smd-applet, eye-candy applet for smd-loop:
	  - attaches to the notification area
	  - stores its configuration using GConf
	  - notifies the user using libnotify
	  - runs smd-loop, interpreting its output
	  - shows the user possible errors and allows him to
	    perform suggested actions by clicking on buttons
	  - complains if smd-loop or smd-push/pull is not configured and
	    forces the user to configure it before starting
	  - automatically run by gnome-session (/etc/xdg/autostart)
	  - shows an item in gnome-control-center
	* smd-loop, cron like push/pull iterator:
	  - use a line based configuration file ~/.smd/loop in the style
	    of cron, calling smd-push/pull with 1 minute granularity
	  - catches some transient errors giving them a second chance;
	    i.e. if the suggested solution is retry, it does so but only 
	    once
	* error report:
	  - smd-client and smd-server output tags describing the 
	    error that caused a sync failure:
	    - context: which part of the software failed, like ssh, 
	      message-deletion, copy-message, ...
	    - probable-cause: something like network, bad file permissions, ...
	    - human-intervention: avoidable or necessary
	    - suggested-actions: run( command ), display-mail, retry, ...
	  - smd-push/smd-pull catch early network errors, so that
	    some tags are output even if smd-client/smd-server is
	    not even run
	* statistics:
	  - smd-client outputs tags describing its last run, comprising
	    the number of added/deleted messages, so that higher level tools
	    can notify the user or collect statistics

28/4/2009 - minor fix and minor feature release
	* support for multiple servers/clients:
	  - config file is now ~/.smd/config.$FOO and smd-push/pull
	    can get an extra argument for FOO, defulat value of FOO is 
	    `default`.
	  - backward-compatibility code added to automatically migrate 
	    the old config file name to the new one
	* cleanup in ~/.smd/:
	  - fifos are now in the fifo/ subdirectory
	  - logs are now in the log/ subdirectory
	* bugfix to mddiff: 
	  - COPYBODY action used to be always followed by an ADD action,
	    that was unnecessary (but not dangerous either).
	* better error reporting:
	  - syncmaildir.lua improved to better report some errors

21/4/2009 - minor fix and minor feature release
	* track only mailmessages (skip other stuff like dovecott indexes):
	  - scans only files in cur/ and new/
	* add COPYBODY command to mddiff:
	  - mails that are moved around and then flagged by MUA
	    are not deteceted anymore as new messages, only the new header
	    is transmitted
	  - smd-client honors the command
	* smd-client better reports network errors:
	  - if no data at all is readable from stdin, it means that
	    the transport (ssh) is not working and this is reported to
	    the user as such

19/4/2009 - major bugfix release
	* major bugfix: 
	  - the db file must be in sync too to grant all changes are detected
	  - the mtime has not to be the same on client and server (thus
	    has to be removed from the db file)
	  - adopt xdelta to calculate a patch for the db file (should be
	    better than diff and can scale to binary, compressed, db file)
	* new client/server protocol: 
	  - allows the server to ABORT
	  - handshake checking protocol version and dbfile hash
	  - at the end transmit and apply the xdelta patch
	* db file format changed:
	  - no more mtime column
	  - added db.txt.mtime auxiliary file to stores a global timestamp 
	    for the whole db
	* minor bugfixes in the code (mostly better error reporting)
	* more documentation

12/4/2009 - first public release
	* end-user tools: smd-pull, smd-push
	* stupid endpoint: smd-server
	* endpoint implementing politics: smd-client
	* low-level tool: mddiff
