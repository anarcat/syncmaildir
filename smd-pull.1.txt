NAME
  smd-pull - syncs the local mail dir letting the remote one untouched

SYNOPSIS
  smd-pull [-d|--dry-run] [-v|--verbose] [-s|--show-tags] [-t|--template-only] [endpoint]

DESCRIPTION
  smd-pull performs in the local maildir all the changes that
  were performed on remote one.

  No changes are made on the remote maildir. Use smd-push(1) for that.

  The first time this program is run a new config file is created and
  the user is asked to edit it. If no endpoint is specified, the configuration
  file is named ~/.smd/config.default, otherwise it is named 
  ~/.smd/config.endpoint. That file is composed by the following fields

  CLIENTNAME  name of the client host
  SERVERNAME  name of the server host
  MAILBOX     list of directories, separated by space

  The field SERVERNAME must be a valid name for ssh, thus can be an alias like
  smd-server-foo.  The default config file contains an example of how to set up
  an alias for ssh.

  The field CLIENTNAME is just an ID for the local host. If you plan to sync
  the same host with multiple remote hosts, you MUST use different values
  for CLIENTNAME for every configuration file.

  The config file is a regular shell script, refer to bash(1) for 
  its syntax.

  The content of the directories ~/.smd/hooks/{pre,post}-pull.d/ is executed
  respectively before and after smd-pull does it's job. They receive
  four arguments: "pre" or "post", "pull", the endpoint name and the status.
  The status is always 0 (meaning success) for pre hooks, while can be 1 (for
  failure) for post hooks. Hooks should not fail, if they do so then
  smd-pull will fail too. 

OPTIONS
  -v --verbose        Verbose output
  -s --show-tags      Machine readable output
  -d --dry-run        Do not perform any action for real
  -t --template-only  Just create a template configuration file if none
  endpoint            Is the suffix for the name of the configuration file to 
		      use. If it is omitted, the configuration file
                      ~/.smd/config.default is used.
