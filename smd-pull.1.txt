NAME
  smd-pull - syncs the local mail dir letting the remote one untouched

SYNOPSIS
  smd-pull [-v] [endpoint]

DESCRIPTION
  smd-pull performs in the local maildir all the changes that
  were performed on remote one.

  No changes are made on the remote maildir. Use smd-push(1) for that.

  The first time this program is run a new config file is created and
  the user is asked to edit it. If no endpoint is specified, the configuration
  file is named ~/.smd/config.default, otherwise it is named 
  ~/.smd/config.endpoint. That file is composed by the following fields

  CLIENTNAME  name of the client host
  SERVERNAME  name of the server host
  MAILBOX     list of directories, separated by space

  The field SERVERNAME must be a valid name for ssh, thus can be an alias like
  smd-server-foo.  The default config file contains an example of how to set up
  an alias for ssh.

  The field CLIENTNAME is just an ID for the local host. If you plan to sync
  the same host with multiple remote hosts, you MUST use different values
  for CLIENTNAME for every configuration file.

  The config file is a regular shell script, refer to bash(1) for 
  its syntax.

OPTIONS
  -v        Verbose, machine readable, output
  endpoint  Is the suffix for the name of the configuration file to use.
            If it is omitted, the configuration file ~/.smd/config.default is
            used.
FILES
  ~/.smd/config.*
