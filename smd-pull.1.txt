NAME
  smd-pull - syncs the local mail dir letting the remote one untouched

SYNOPSIS
  smd-pull

DESCRIPTION
  smd-pull performs in the local maildir all the changes that
  were performed on remote one.

  No changes are made on the remote maildir. Use smd-push(1) for that.

  The first time this program is run a new config file is created and
  the user is asked to edit it. That file is composed by the following
  fields

  CLIENTNAME  name of the client host
  SERVERNAME  name of the server host
  MAILBOX A list of directories, separated by space

  The fields CLIENTNAME and SERVERNAME must be valid names for 
  ssh, thus can be aliases like smd-foo and smd-bar. 
  The default config file contains an example of how to set up an alias
  for ssh.

  The config file is a regular shell script, refer to bash(1) for 
  its syntax.

FILES
  ~/.smd/config
