SYNOPSIS
  smd-translate [-m mode] [-d direction] endpoint mailbox

DESCRIPTION
  smd-translate translates mailbox names according to predefined patterns.
  It is designed to be used in the configuration file of smd-push(1) and
  smd-pull(1).

  Refer to smd-config(5) for a longer discussion on translators.

  Supported modes follow.

  oimap-dovecot  

  This mode is designed to make the transition of offlineimap users to
  smd simpler. It assumes remote mailboxes are named like in the 
  following:
    
    Maildir/cur
    Maildir/.sub.folder/new
    
  The corresponding local mailboxes are named like in the following:
    
    Mail/cur
    Mail/sub.folder/new
    
USAGE IN CONFIGURATION FILE
  Assuming the MAILBOX_LOCAL configuration variable is set to Mail
  and the MAILBOX_REMOTE is set to Maildir, one can use the following
  configuration file snippet in ~/.smd/config.endpoint:
  
    TRANSLATOR_RL="smd-translate -m oimap-dovecot -d RL endpoint"
    TRANSLATOR_LR="smd-translate -m oimap-dovecot -d LR endpoint"
    
  To test your setup use the smd-check-translators(1) utility.
