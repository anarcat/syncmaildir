NAME
  mddiff - computes diff for maildirs
SYNOPSIS
  mddiff [--max-mailno mno] [--db-file dbf] [-v|--verbose] [--help] paths
DESCRIPTION
  mddiff computes the delta from an old status of a maildir (previously
  recorded in a support file, called db file) and the current status, 
  generating a set of commands (a diff) that a third party software can 
  apply to synchronize a (eventually remote) copy of the maildir.

  If paths is a list of regular files, mddiff outputs the sha1 of its header
  and body separated by space.

  If paths is a list of directories, mddiff outputs a list of actions a client
  has to perform to syncronize a copy of the same maildirs. This set of actions
  is relative to a previous status of the maildir stored in the db file.
  The input directories are traversed recursively, and every file encountered
  is a potential mail message (if it contains no \\n\\n it is skipped).

      $ mddiff ~/Mail/
      ADD ~/Mail/cur/1239038050.14937_1.garfield:2,S 66532ebb05b252e... 
      ...
  
  Regular files and directories cannot be mixed in paths.
  
  Every client must use a different db-file, and the db-file is strictly
  related with the set of directories given as arguments, and should not
  be used with a different directory set. Adding items to the directory
  set is safe, while removing them may not do what you want (delete actions
  are generated).

  mddiff does not alter the dbf file, it generates a new one called dbf.new.
  It is up to the higher level tool smd-server(1) to rename dbf.new to dbf 
  in case the other endpoint successfully applied the diff.

OPTIONS
  --max-mailno mno      Estimation of max mail message number (default 500000)
                        Decrease for small systems, it is increased
                        automatically if needed
  --db-file dbf         Name of the cache for the endpoint (default db.txt)
  -v --verbose          Increase program verbosity (printed on stderr)
  --help                This help screen

NOTES
  mddiff is a low level utility, used by smd-server and smd-client. You
  should use higher level tools like smd-pull(1) and smd-push(1)
