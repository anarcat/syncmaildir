NAME
  smd-uniform-names - renames local mails as on the remote host

SYNOPSIS
  smd-uniform-names [-v|--verbose] [endpoint]

DESCRIPTION
  smd-uniform-names is useful to migrate from offlineimap to smd.
  offlineimap may name the same email differently on the local and
  remote host. This utility generates a script to be run on the local
  host to uniform the names to the remote ones.

  The utility generates the script '~/smd-rename.sh' that has to be run
  by the user.
