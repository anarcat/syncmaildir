NAME
  smd-client - receives diffs and performs actions

SYNOPSIS
  smd-client [-v|--verbose] [-d|--dry-run] [-t|--translator]
	[-l|--local-sync] [--rename-only]
	[--override-db dbf] endpoint mailboxes

DESCRIPTION
  smd-client needs to know a name (endpoint) for the client (that must not
  be used by others) and a list of mailboxes (directories).

  smd-client waits on stdin a mail dir diff. It attempts to 
  execute these actions, eventually asking data printing commands
  on stdout and expecting the data on stdin. 

OPTIONS
  -t --translator  Specify a program to translate remote mailbox names to 
                   local ones. Note that the translator 'cat' (the identity
                   program) is optimized away
  -l --local-sync  Local synchronization, no changes is made to the db-file
                   since smd-server takes care of it
  --rename-only    Do not synchronize the mailboxes but generate the 
                   script '~/smd-rename.sh' to uniform the files names in the
                   mailbox
  --override-db dbf  Use dbf as the db-file
  -v --verbose     Increase program verbosity (printed on stderr)
  -d --dry-run     Do not perform any action for real

NOTES
  smd-client is a low level utility. You should use higher level tools like
  smd-pull(1) and smd-push(1)
