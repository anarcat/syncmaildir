NAME
  smd-client - receives diffs and performs actions

SYNOPSIS
  smd-client [-v|--verbose] [-d|--dry-run] 
             [-w|--wait-for-disconnect] endpoint mailboxes

DESCRIPTION
  smd-client needs to know a name (endpoint) for the client (that must not
  be used by others) and a list of mailboxes (directories).

  smd-client waits on stdin a mail dir diff. It attempts to 
  execute these actions, eventually asking data printing commands
  on stdout and expecting the data on stdin. 

OPTIONS
  -v --verbose              Increase program verbosity (printed on stderr)
  -d --dry-run              Do not perform any action for real
  -w --wait-for-disconnect  Wait the disconnection of the other endpoint
                            bofore exiting

NOTES
  smd-client is a low level utility. You should use higher level tools like
  smd-pull(1) and smd-push(1)

  mddiff(1), smd-server(1), smd-pull(1), smd-push(1)
