NAME
  smd-client - receives diffs and performs actions

SYNOPSIS
  smd-client [-v]

DESCRIPTION
  smd-client waits on stdin a mail dir diff. It attempts to 
  execute these actions, eventually asking data printing commands
  on stdout and expecting the data on stdin. 

OPTIONS

NOTES
  smd-client is a low level utility. You should use higher level tools like
  smd-pull(1) and smd-push(1)
